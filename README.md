# Library Management System

A simple command-line library management system in Python that allows users to display available books, lend a book, add new books, and return books. The system tracks the books in a library and enables users to interact with the library through a set of menu-driven options.

## Features
- **Display Books**: Shows the list of all books currently available in the library.
- **Lend a Book**: Allows a user to lend a book, removing it from the library's list of available books.
- **Add a Book**: Enables a user to add new books to the library's collection.
- **Return a Book**: Lets users return a book, adding it back to the library's collection.

## How It Works
1. **Library Setup**: The library is initialized with a list of books and a name.
2. **Menu Options**:
   - Display all available books.
   - Lend a book by choosing its index from the displayed list.
   - Add new books to the library by specifying how many books and their titles.
   - Return borrowed books by specifying how many and their titles.
3. **User Interaction**: Users can choose options to interact with the library, and after each operation, they are prompted to continue or quit.
